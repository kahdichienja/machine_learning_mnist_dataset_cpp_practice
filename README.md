- **CMake**: For managing the build process.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **MNIST Dataset**: Ensure you download the MNIST dataset if not already provided in the `data/` directory.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kahdichienja/machine_learning_mnist_dataset_cpp_practice.git
   cd machine_learning_mnist_dataset_cpp_practice
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:

   Use CMake to configure and build the project.

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

3. **Run the Executable**:

## Usage

### Loading the MNIST Dataset

The code includes functions to read and preprocess the MNIST dataset. Ensure the dataset is available in the `data/` directory or update the dataset path in the code.

### Implemented Features

The `src` directory in the `machine_learning_mnist_dataset_cpp_practice` repository contains the core C++ source files that implement various machine learning algorithms applied to the MNIST dataset. Here's an overview of the key components:

1. **Data Handling**:
   - **DataHandler.cc**: Manages the loading, processing, and splitting of the MNIST dataset into training, testing, and validation sets. It reads image and label data, normalizes feature vectors, and organizes data for model training and evaluation. 

2. **Data Representation**:
   - **data.cc**: Defines the `Data` class, representing individual data points. This class stores feature vectors, labels, and provides methods for setting and retrieving these attributes. It also includes functionality for normalizing data and calculating distances between data points. 

3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
   - Implements the KNN algorithm for classifying handwritten digits. It calculates distances between data points to determine the nearest neighbors and predicts labels based on majority voting among neighbors. 

4. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Implements the K-Means clustering algorithm, which groups similar data points together. This is useful for tasks like unsupervised learning and data analysis on the MNIST dataset. 

5. **Neural Network Components**:
   - Defines the `Layer` class, representing a layer in a neural network. It initializes neurons and manages the connections between layers, facilitating forward and backward propagation during training. 

6. **Common Utilities**:
   - Provides utility functions and common definitions used across different modules, aiding in tasks like mathematical computations and data manipulations.

These components work together to facilitate the training and evaluation of machine learning models on the MNIST dataset, providing a comprehensive practice environment for implementing and understanding machine learning algorithms in C++.
